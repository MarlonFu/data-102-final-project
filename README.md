# Introduction
In this project, we evaluate Bayesian versus Frequentist methods for predicting election results and perform casual inference for those results. This project was originally designed as a final project for [Data 102: Data Inference and Decisions](https://data102.org/fa22/) at UC Berkeley, taught by Professor Jacob Steinhardt and Professor Ramesh Sridharan.

# Getting Started
Set up the environment by running `conda env create -f environment.yml` in the command line. The main source code for the project is included in `Project.ipynb`.
